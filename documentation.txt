Python Modules Used:
- threading
- msvcrt

Files:

| main.py : Main program. Run only this to start the program properly.
| system_files
| | keyhit_reader.py : Reads keyhits. Will frequently be used by other programs to know what to do depending on the user input
| | sysfunc.py : Stores important functions related to this program.
| interfaces
| | _001_front_menu.py : Hosts text and other functions for the front menu (the menu you first see upon opening the main.py file)
| lang
| | locale_EN.py : Stores values about non-hard coded text. This is where programmers can edit the language


Logic Flow:

- main.py runs
- thread1 and thread2 runs. 
- thread2 will start the keyhit reader. The code there will mostly contain
code that's required by other py files
- thread1 will run the main code.











keyhit_reader.py logic flow:
- import the needed methods and variables
- method is defined. will be executed once at main.py
- uses the global keyword to make the changes on the file's key_hit variable be accessible to the other py files live
- special_key_hit var's purpose is to serve as a "passage" for the follow-up execution of special key hits (for example,
the down key will make the msvcrt.getch() run twice in a while loop)
- special_key_tag var's purpose is to record the value of the first part of a special key hit to specify which key was used
- while loop starts (as long as the program is running)
- if kbhit(): meaning, if a key hit is performed, it will run
- the value of the key hit is stored at raw_key_hit and has been converted to string

- if the output detects the values of backspace and enter key, run their respective commands
